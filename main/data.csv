A Really Good Gaming Mouse (Coming from a former Logitech G502 Lightspeed User),"The media could not be loaded. Razer delivers on what it promises - a good gaming experience - for gamers, by gamers. The DeathAdder V2 is nothing less than a brilliant mouse that gets all the right checkboxes checked. So I have used an array of mice in the past with the likes of HyperX, Logitech and SteelSeries to name a few. However, the longest mouse that I stuck to was the Logitech G502 Lightspeed (wireless). To be honest, I have always been a big fan of the Hero sensor that Logitech uses. As a person with big hands, the G502 snuggled in almost perfectly and the claw grip was good. Story cut short, thanks to the bad-build-quality that Logitech is famous for, the mouse broke and it did not feel right to spend over ₹10,000 this time. As a result, I got the DeathAdder V2 and here are the pros and the cons (uncategorized) that I noticed immediately, and in a span of a few days- 1. Size - The V2 is slightly smaller (5 x 2.43 x 1.68 inches) than the G502 (5.17 x 2.96 x 1.62 inches) but due to the slight bump, it feels a tad bit bigger. Nonetheless, thanks to my large hands, the semi-claw grip is just fine for me. 2. Sensor - The sensor on the V2 seemed to be similar to the one on the G502. However, the detection on the DeathAdder V2 felt slightly better (probably because of the wired X wireless factor). 3. Grip - The grip is okay-ish as I still prefer the one on the G502. Both mice have rubberized grips on the sides but the curvy edges make the G502 a better mouse to move around and lift from the mouse-pad. The DeathAdder V2 has an inward incline on the edges that makes it rather uncomfortable to lift off from the table (can be difficult for low-sensitivity players). As mentioned earlier, I use a semi-claw grip on this one. 4. Wire/Cable - I have never used a bungee. Even though the G502 Lightspeed had a cable, I still preferred the hassle-free wireless mode. However, its cable looked more premium than the one on the V2 - but due to its finesse, it was heavy. The V2's cable is lighter and easy to move around; but has a defect in my product (please refer to the video). 5. Weight - It feels so good to be back to a light-weight mouse (barely 82 grams). The G502 Lightspeed was a hefty 114/115 grams so using it for longer periods was exasperating. 6. Build Quality - The build quality of the DeathAdder V2 is amazing, no moving parts and great body balance. The plastic is of the premium quality that looks durable. The G502 on the other hand had a very bad build quality. There were moving plastics inside the mouse and it had a weight hollowness to it (maybe because of its infinite scroll-wheel). My verdict - The Razer DeathAdder V2 is a bang for the buck mouse. I bought it for ₹3599 on sale. In case you are looking forward to buying it, wait for an Amazon sale. It is definitely the best mouse under ₹4000 for sure. Peace & Happy Gaming! BONUS - About the attached video - My mouse has an issue with its cable. You see, the initial half of the cable (from the mouse) is a lot stiffer than the latter half. This makes it bend in weird ways that cause problems when moving the mouse around (especially during fast flicks and movements). I have asked Amazon for a replacement - *fingers crossed* - let's see how it goes.","Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
For gaming this is it,This is the best mouse I have used so far.. I have go through about 5 different brands and this is the one that just clicked.,"Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
Ergonomic gaming mouse for giant hands.,"To review this mouse, I must first set the context. Previously I had cm MX 711, an extremely small and light mouse and before this, steelseries rival 300, a rather huge mouse. What I currently wanted is a mouse that works on most surfaces, good for work as well as good for fps gaming. Not the best, but good enough would be fine for me. Either I would have gone with two different mouse, one for work and another for gaming, or I needed a mouse which can do both. Mx711 was too small for work and doesn't work on all surfaces. Riva 300 was uncomfortable. Deathadder V2 seemed to be the only mouse, that fir my budget that can satisfy all my requirements and it did flawlessly. Its huge sure, not the best for fps, but it's good enough. Its light enough. My hands would rather appreciate medium size mouses for gaming. But deathadder V2, my god the comfort was heavenly. Razer really nailed this one for me.","Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
A very good product,"Very comfortable. Good quality materials used. Very responsive and a VERY GOOD fit in hand (especially for palm grip) and very good RGB effects. I have included a pic of my hand with a Cello Maxwriter pen for size reference of my hand. And it fits my hand beautifully. The Razer Synapse is a good software, haven't encountered any bugs yet. We can customize the RGB effects there and can set 5 different DPI setting which we can change on the go with the two buttons behind the scroll wheel. Only issue being that there is no visible indication to know which DPI setting is on, you will have to see how the cursoe repsonds to guess it. We can also set the polling rate from 1000Hz to 125Hz and it is set at 1000Hz by default, which is great. Overall a good mouse for gaming and normal day-to-day use. Can't complain (yet). 10/10.","Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
The best Mouse Ever,"The best mouse for Gaming ever , used 3 Years my mouse didn't stopped working but instead the more i used the buttons of right and left click got loose and therefore when I click it double click on a very low pressure But yes the accuracy is 99.9 % Razer is a very old trust worthy  Gaming Brand I love this mouse so much it is just Very good for counterstrike and DotA 2 Games The weight of mouse is very low as compared to Logitech or steel series The design is very good The shape is nice for the person whose hands is big or medium but for the girls or small hand person this mouse is not for them because mouse size is big, for people whose hands are small they can go buy Razer Viper Mini. I like the RGB of the mouse with 6 different colours. The mouse is good for games like shooting as Counterstrike , PubG , Valorant, COD You get the profile button also to change it with installing Razer synapse software The real downside of this mouse is it very expensive as compared to other mouse but I can guarantee you that this mouse is better then other brand mouse, So You can purchasing this mouse blindly and yet it worth  spending money Also you it says 2 years warranty which you have to claim it but I already used this product 3 years without claiming warranty and now I can trust the product believe me when you will use this product you will know what I truly mean when you start Gaming The above mouse are my old death adder elite 16k Dpi and new death adder elite V2 20k dpi pictures Also I forgot the new speed flex cable which is 10 times better than braided cables which doesn't stingle This mouse is the best mouse for me to Game and level up","Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
the best mouse,overall for fps games and popular games like fornite roblox bedwars and minecraft its a really good mouse for windows os,"Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"

Perfect for bigger handa with claw grip and palm grip,"This mouse is greatly lightweight as compared to its size and the ergonomics is good but in my personal opinion, every gamer should consider some factors regarding choosing a new mouse. 1- their grip style 2- hand size(very imp) 3-weight of mouse 4-sensor(if you pick from well known brands like logitech, razer, hyperx, cooler master then sensor really doesn't matter) 5-PTFE feet 6-durability(at least 50 million clicks, this mouse has 70 million clicks) This mouse is really great for accuracy and tracking is awesome. Go for it if you have bigger hands(suitable for XL size) and if you like the bigger tail shape. I have big hands too but i have finger tip style with palm rest so it feels a little big to my hands because of the big tail shape but this product is really worth the money. Clicks are great and scroll wheel is just fine. It is incredibly lightweight with great cable(Razer's speedflex cable). If you are looking for mouse with palm fingertip hybrid grip then here are some 1-Razer viper lineup(get the ultimate if you can afford) 2-hyperx pulsefire haste(best choice if in stock) 3-logitech g pro x superlight(not the lighest though)","Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
Only for palm grip,It is best mouse for palm grip. But not for claw or figertip. It is doable but the grip is not the ergonomic to hand,"Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
Purrrfect-o!,"I would give it 5 stars for its sensitivity, accuracy, speed and smoothness. However, I took 1 star from it because it's ADDICTIVE. If you get used to this you won't be able to settle for less. I use this for gaming but switching back to the ₹200 generic mouse for work, takes some getting use to. CS-GO review: If you're switching from a lower dpi mouse to this, it'll take you a few games to get accustomed to the sensitivity and you'll probably suck at best, but once you've done that, the result is sweet.","Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
Focus is osm,I love it good for gaming,"Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
Amazing Mouse even if a little pricey,"This is the first Razer mouse I have purchased and so far I am pleased with the experience. The build is solid, the weight is light and tracking is very accurate. My only gripe with the product is their software that prevents your RGB customization from saving in the Windows lockscreen (every other RGB product I own saves the settings except Razer).","Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"

Amazing mouse with an underwhelming software,The mouse in itself is too good. The overall build quality might not be at par with the price tag of the mouse but it is not noticeable and can be overlooked when compared to other attributes of this mouse. One thing I did not like about the overall Razer experience was the Synapse software that is used to store on board profiles and customize the buttons and RGB. Please note that you will not be able to retain the RGB settings of a particular profile if you close the software from running in the background. It retains everything except the RGB profiles so it was a turn off for me. If you do not care that much about color then it is not problem at all.,"Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
What a great mouse ..just awesome,Believe  me guys that in hand feel of this mouse is really good and wheel color what to say ...just superb. I really love clicking on this mouse it feels a so smooth i was having earlier logitech 402 that end up in double clicking issue after 2 years of use . That mouse was decent moues though but believe me guys logitech mouse nowhere near to build quality of this one ...really loved the product...,"Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"

Really good gaming mouse but a bit overpriced,I recieved this mouse (razer deathadder v2) today and i can truly say that this is the best gaming mouse i have ever used pros - 1. The shape of this ergonomic mouse is so good. It feels really comfortable to use. My hands are 17.5 cm which is the average hand size and i can use this mouse without any issues for long sessions and i can also recommend this mouse to anyone with the same palm size or greater 2. The rgb lighting on the mouse looks pretty cool 3. The weight of this mouse is only 82 grams which means it is perfect for any kind of fps or fast paced games. I played csgo for hours and enjoyed the experience 4. The overall build quality is amazing. mouse feels sturdy and well built. cons - 1. The clicks feel ok as sometimes you cannot tell whether you have clicked or not if you are using headphones due to them being spongey. You need to hear the sound of the click to confirm 2. Bit overpriced,"Razer DeathAdder V2 Wired Gaming Mouse | 8 Programmable Buttons | 20,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Chroma RGB Lighting - Classic Black - RZ01-03210100-R3M1"
It is truly the best mouse money can buy,"I would to start by saying I have big hands and so I needed something that fit comfortably Let me assure you this is a very well designed mouse, the dpi sensor, mouse clicks and all other components like braided cable feels premium.

Tracking God !,"Shifter from Razer Viper to DA V2. Build and quality is very good. Tracking is insane. Definitely lighter than previous DA's.
