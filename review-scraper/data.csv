"LOGITECH REPLACE OLD BORING BASIC OMRON SWITCHES PLEASE !!!!","Be a little careful when you receive the package. There are two versions of this mouse. One is old with the rubberized usb wire, while the v2 has braided cable. The mouse box has sticker planted on a side by the seller which actually hides the mfg date. If you get a non braided cable post Nov 2022, you can change it immediately by calling the ACC or can stay with the rubberized usb wire (apart from that there are no differences at all). About the review there's nothing much except for the fact that Logitech still uses those cheap & basic OMRON switches which goes kaput if you are a MMORPG gamer. They should really improve their quality of switches with KAIHL atleast. Even puny & non branded mouse these days use red tactile switches (way better than OMRON) and are less expensive. So being a vivid user of G502 since it's launch I'm very disappointed. Apologies for ranting, but this will be my last Logitech mouse with Omron switches. And guess what I actually paid ₹4k for it. Even in offline shops you'll get ₹150 mouse with the same switches, does everything like a mouse does except the whole GAMING TANTRUMS. Pfft Logitech. Grow up.","Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, Hero 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC/Mac - Black"

"Customizable 5 weights & 11 Buttons, Hyper Scroll and High DPI/RGB. But the best thing is G HUB!","The media could not be loaded. Customization: 5/5 Buttons: 5/5 Features: 5/5 Control: 5/5 Durability: 5/5 Grip: 4/5 RGB: 5/5 Review: G502 Hero fills the gaps of the previous G502. Hero is the perfect companion for all of your gaming needs. Let me get into each of them one by one. Don't miss the G HUB! Programmable Buttons: It features 11 buttons that are fully programmable. These include Forward/Backward, DPI Up/Down, G-Shift, Middle Click, Left/Right Click, Profile Cycle and Left/Right Scroll. Refer my image for visualization. Holding G-Shift in the default mode changes DPI to a preset which you can customize. For example, I hold it while snipping to lower my DPI to 1200 in FPS games and increase accuracy. Besides lowering the DPI, G-Shift button can also make existing buttons perform other functionality than their defaults. This gives you another set of 10 new controls! Yes, it does have horizontal scroll that enables left/right scrolling. I use it to change tabs in Chrome. Profile Cycle button helps me to cycle between different profiles easily. Not to miss that all of these are fully customizable on a per-app basis! Hyper Scroll: The scroll features as a frictionless one. Just scroll it once on a long webpage, leave it and it will keep scrolling even after you reach the end. Don't worry, you have a toggle just under it that can disable this feature. RGB: The space allotted is less. You can customize RGB settings for the Logo and the profile indicator on per-app basis. Choose modes between Cycle, Breathing, Fixed, Music and Screen. Music mode works as visualizer based on the playing track. Screen mode changes colour according to what's on your screen. For example, I have made profile for GRIS that makes my G502 to change colour to white and red depending on what's on left and middle side of the screen. The profile indicator in default mode helps you see the profile or DPI level when you change among the max 5. Weights: You get 5 3.6 grams weight bars that you can align in the weight compartment of the mouse as per your convenience. You have options for left/right and forward/backward alignments. A single weight can be aligned in 13 different ways! I've made a weight adjustment video so that you can see how weights are adjusted in G502. Grip and Durability: The mouse looks rock solid. If you have not too large hands, yours can rest comfortably over the mouse. There is a thumb rest while the curvature of the mouse is a treat to your right hand. Beware, left-handers! G HUB: The best thing about this mouse is the software. Yes, you read it right. With G HUB, you can make custom profiles (or even download from the community) for each app. Thus, you can change RGB colours and mode, buttons mapping, DPI settings and G-Shift/DPI-Shift for a particular app. I have even set a profile for Chrome that enhances my productivity. You can find profiles made by me on G HUB by the name 'Baahubali'. What amazed me is that besides Macros (Keyboard key combinations), Shortcuts and Keyboard Keys, you can even build scripts in Lua programming language - now this is something really professional by team. This was my first purchase of a premium gaming mouse. Previously, I had been buying Dragonwar mice. I read somewhere that this mouse is a one-time investment and now I believe they are right. Experiencing the hyper frictionless scroll gives you an idea about how reliable the mouse promises to be! With a price tag on 4K, it's a steal. You may get as minimum as INR 3799 in Lightning Deals. Do check my detailed photos and unboxing videos. I had to follow Amazon Video Format Specs so do visit YouTube (Paras Lehana) to view highest quality video of Unboxing and Weight Adjustment.","Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, Hero 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC/Mac - Black"

"A little too sensitive","Overall its great, i just find it a little too sensitive a little bump or move on the mouse whatever you are doing its going to be affected. The fire button (with the crosshair) its going to be a paint if you use it for anything else. I always bump it to the right side of the keyboard un intentionally and whatever fucntion i gave it is activated again un internationally.","Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, Hero 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC/Mac - Black"
"Heavy Weight For Gaming","I am using this mouse for over 6 months now, it is still working perfectly fine. The grip and buttons are pretty cool, but I would not recommend if your hand is short. Also it was initially good for games but I feel like a lighter mouse is better option for games(Would Recommend Light Logitech mouse). The light is working great, Logitech software is easy to manage. Definitely worth recommending, however, do remember it’s heavy. [Update - It's been over a year now, the mouse buttons are all fine but the left click button has some issues, for example when I am holding it and using it as a spray in a game the shoot button(left click) automatically gets unclicked. Also just noticed I bought it for 6.3k inr and now it sells for around 3500-4000, which is very bad.","Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, Hero 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC/Mac - Black"
"No need to spend this much","Hi, I bought this mouse for gaming as i usually play csgo, I had a MX 518 earlier which stopped working after using it for 3yrs. Meanwhile i have been using a wireless mouse from logitech which wasnt meant for gaming though. Now to conclude the worth. It is a great mouse in itself but there would be certain things to look for if u really want to buy this or not. 1. As per its design, i did not find it to be extremely good but a rather decent design, i am saying this because i had my little finger constantly rubbing on the mat as it is a bit less extended towards right which put its out of perfect grip. 2. The dpi is 16000 which is absolutely not required and i realized after buying this mouse. MX 518 had 1800dpi which was far more than sufficient. and had a very perfect grip. 3. The infinity roll did not come out to be much of a use unless u wanted to reach the end of ""terms and agreement page"". 4. The primary buttons are far too extended to the top which led to missed clicks while playing csgo. u need to be clicking at the far top. 5. The dpi switch often get clicked in the play. That may be jst me. or they could have jst been on top like before. or u switch them it is a well built mouse with good response with very little flaws, but i seriously feel that u dnt have to spend additional money on it. This is to all those gamers out there who really want to have a good gear. Trust me u rlly dont have to burn ur pockets deep, jst get any mouse with upto 2000 dpi if u are an fps person. For dota gow  where in u need lots of buttons, this would still fail. SO YEAH, U CAN GET BETTER AT LOWER PRICES IF U R AN FPS PERSON","Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, Hero 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC/Mac - Black"

"There is a reason it is one of the best selling mice.","The mice has a nice rubberized texture, a well balanced and ergonomic design.","Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, Hero 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC/Mac - Black"
"The Gaming Mouse Real Gamers","I have reviewed many electronics before mice, headsets, keyboards and more, but when it comes to Products and the Price and the expectations we have because of the price, I can say I'm never really disappointed, when you buy Buget Gaming preiferals, you have basic expectation. But when it comes to dropping something like 4k on a mouse, then you know even if you are the richest or the poorest, you know that you are gonna have high expectations. And I did when I bought this mouse and I can happily say that this is a product way way better than its price range. The shape. The shape of the mouse is amazing, it's a right handed Ergonomic shape with comfort and quality in mind, it is a great shape, comfortable but quick and the grip is well textured. The Usefulness. I mainly play fortnite battle Royal and I recently switched from controller to Kbm, and to make sure that my tech wasn't holding me back, I threw my old Ant esp mouse and immidialy bought this and when I first held it in my hand, I was super impressed, you have a lot of coustomizing abilities. You can increase the weight, with the G Hub software you can coustomize the DPI and Lighting and other things. With the inbuilt memory you can change between 5 DPI presets to increase or decrease you DPI, and with the sniper button it becomes a real competitive advantage. Compared to mice like The Razer Viper or the Glorious Model O, it's heavy, but it's stable and it's really Ergonomic. Conclusion. For anyone who has the Buget and wants to go pro, this is by far the easiest recommendation I can give ya'll, I hope you found this review useful and thank you Logitech.","Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, Hero 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC/Mac - Black"
"Good looking mouse","One thing I did not like about this mouse, Logitech started giving normal wire with mouse. Earlier it was braided cable used to come with the mouse. Built for gaming. Weight come with mouse.","Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, Hero 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC/Mac - Black"
"Totally Worthy in 2022","I was using G402 few years back and then I shifted towards Razer and bought Razer Deathadder essential. But tbh using G402 with extra button and then using Razer with 5 buttons I was not happy but I tried Razer. No doubt Razer make a good products but with limitations. I was about to buy Razer Viper but then I thought let’s try G502 because both are coming from same price segment. And G502 contains more functions as compared to Viper mini. If you re planning to buy this just go for it blindly.","Logitech G502 Hero High Performance Wired Gaming Mouse, Hero 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, RGB, Adjustable Weights, 11 Programmable Buttons, On-Board Memory, PC/Mac - Black"
"Best Gaming Mouse for Professionals","This was the first ever gaming mouse I held in 2016 (Proteus Spectrum then). As soon as I put my palm over this, I felt a strange power flowing through me and I decided whenever I'll get a job, this mouse is going to be first thing I will buy. I bought this for few features like - High sensitivity which adds little more accuracy to it. 11 Programmable Buttons to assign shortcut keys. Adjustable weights which provides CG adjustment (even if little). Big bulky size which support my large palms. On-board Memory profiling to switch between different scenarios. To put simply, This is the mouse if you game hard and work hard because this big guy has it all.
